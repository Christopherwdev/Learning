     * Example: Human cells.  
   * Prokaryotic Cells:  
     * Lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.  
     * Example: Bacterial cells.  
2. Cell Specialisation:  
   * Eukaryotic cells may differ in the number and types of organelles.

## 2\. Reproduction and Inheritance

### 2.1 Chromosomes

In most cells, excluding sex cells, chromosomes exist in pairs, with one inherited from each parent. These pairs are referred to as homologous chromosomes. Each chromosome carries genes at specific positions called loci. While homologous chromosomes share the same genes and loci, they may have different alleles for those genes.

### 2.2 Meiosis

Key Terms:

* Chromatid: After DNA replication, chromosomes consist of two identical sister chromatids, each containing the same genetic information.  
* Gamete: A haploid sex cell.  
* Zygote: The diploid cell formed when two gametes fuse.  
* Haploid: A cell with half the usual amount of DNA (e.g., human sex cells with 23 chromosomes).  
* Diploid: A cell with a complete set of DNA (e.g., human somatic cells with 46 chromosomes).

Sexual reproduction introduces genetic variation through meiosis and random fertilization. Meiosis is a cell division process that produces haploid gametes, which fuse during fertilization to form a diploid zygote. Before cell division, DNA exists as uncondensed chromatin. After replication, meiosis proceeds as follows:

1. Prophase I: Chromatin condenses into chromosomes, the nuclear envelope dissolves, and spindle fibers form.  
2. Metaphase I: Homologous chromosome pairs align at the cell's center.  
3. Anaphase I: Spindle fibers pull homologous chromosomes to opposite poles.  
4. Telophase I: Nuclear envelopes form around each set of chromosomes.  
5. Cytokinesis: The cytoplasm divides, resulting in two cells.

The process repeats in meiosis II, but with single chromosomes aligning and chromatids separating, producing four genetically unique haploid cells.

### 2.3 Genetic Variation

Meiosis contributes to genetic variation through:

* Independent Assortment: During metaphase I, homologous chromosomes align randomly, creating diverse chromosome combinations in gametes.  
* Crossing Over: In prophase I, homologous chromosomes exchange chromatid segments, generating new allele combinations. The structure formed during this process is called a bivalent.

### 2.4 Gene Linkage

Genes on the same chromosome are often inherited together due to chromosome linkage. For example, if a dog has genes for hair length and color on the same chromosome, the alleles for long/brown or short/blond hair will be inherited together unless crossing over occurs.

### 2.5 Mammalian Gametes and Fertilization

Egg Cell:

* Contains the zona pellucida, a protective layer preventing polyspermy.  
* Has a haploid nucleus to restore diploidy upon fertilization.  
* Contains cortical granules that harden the zona pellucida after fertilization.  
* Surrounded by follicle cells for protection.

Sperm Cell:

* Packed with mitochondria to power the flagellum for movement.  
* Contains an acrosome with enzymes to penetrate the zona pellucida.

Fertilization Process:

1. Sperm enzymes digest the zona pellucida.  
2. The sperm head fuses with the egg membrane, allowing the nucleus to enter.  
3. Cortical granules harden the zona pellucida, blocking additional sperm.  
4. The nuclei fuse, forming a diploid zygote.

### 2.6 Flowering Plants

Flower Structure:

* Stamen: Male part, consisting of anthers that produce pollen.  
* Carpel: Female part, where ovules develop.

Pollination: The transfer of pollen to the stigma, facilitated by wind or insects. Fertilization results in seed formation, which develops into fruit.  
Double Fertilization:

1. Pollen grains germinate on the stigma, forming a pollen tube.  
2. The tube grows through the stigma, digesting tissue for nutrients.  
3. It enters the embryo sac via the micropyle.  
4. The generative cell divides into two sperm cells.  
5. One sperm fuses with the egg to form a zygote.  
6. The other fuses with polar nuclei to form the endosperm.  
7. The fertilized ovule develops into an embryo, with the integuments becoming the seed coat and the ovary forming the fruit.

### 2.7 Mitosis

Mitosis is the process by which somatic cells divide for growth and repair. It involves:

1. Prophase: Chromatin condenses into chromosomes, the nuclear envelope dissolves, and spindle fibers form.  
2. Metaphase: Chromosomes align at the cell's center.  
3. Anaphase: Chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles.  
4. Telophase: Nuclear envelopes reform.  
5. Cytokinesis: The cytoplasm divides, producing two genetically identical diploid cells.

### 2.8 The Cell Cycle

The cell cycle consists of:

* G1 Phase: Cell growth and protein synthesis.  
* S Phase: DNA replication.  
* G2 Phase: Preparation for mitosis.  
* Mitosis: Cell division.

Cells spend about 10% of their time in mitosis and 90% in interphase.  
Mitotic Index: The proportion of dividing cells in a tissue sample, calculated as:  
Number of cells with visible chromosomes รท Total number of cells observed.

### 2.9 Stem Cells

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells capable of specializing into various cell types. Types include:

* Totipotent: Can form any cell type, including placental cells.  
* Pluripotent: Can form many cell types, excluding placental cells.  
* Multipotent: Limited to specific cell lineages.  
* Unipotent: Can only produce one cell type.

Stem cells are used in treating diseases and regenerating damaged tissues but raise ethical concerns due to embryo use.

### 2.10 Cell Specialization

Specialization occurs when specific genes are activated, producing proteins that alter the cell's structure and function. This process is irreversible.

### 2.11 Phenotype

Phenotype results from genetic and environmental interactions. For example, skin color is genetically determined but can be influenced by sunlight exposure.

### 2.12 Epigenetics

Epigenetics studies gene expression changes caused by environmental factors without altering DNA sequences. Mechanisms include:

* DNA Methylation: Adding methyl groups to DNA, reducing gene expression.  
* Histone Acetylation: Adding acetyl groups to histones, making DNA more accessible for transcription.

Epigenetic changes can be inherited, affecting gene expression across generations.

### 2.13 Polygenic Inheritance

Polygenic traits are controlled by multiple genes and often influenced by the environment, leading to continuous variation (e.g., height, skin color).

### 2.14 Multiple Alleles

Some traits are influenced by multiple alleles, such as blood groups (IA, IB, IO), resulting in multiple phenotypes (A, B, AB, O).

## 3\. Plant Structure

### 3.1 Plant Cells

Plant cells are eukaryotic cells found in plants and algae. They share many organelles with animal cells but also possess unique structures. The ultrastructure of a plant cell includes:

* Cell Wall: Located outside the cell membrane, it is composed of cellulose, a polysaccharide that provides strength, support, and shape to the cell. It contains pores for substance exchange.  
* Chloroplasts: Flattened structures with a double membrane, containing stacked thylakoids. Chlorophyll within absorbs light for photosynthesis.  
* Amyloplasts: Organelles that synthesize and store starch, breaking it down into glucose when needed.  
* Vacuole: A membrane-bound sac filled with cell sap (containing sugars and salts) that maintains turgor pressure and isolates harmful substances.  
* Tonoplast: The membrane surrounding the vacuole.  
* Plasmodesmata: Cytoplasmic channels between adjacent cells, enabling communication and substance exchange.  
* Pits: Thin areas in the cell wall allowing fluid exchange between neighboring cells.  
* Middle Lamella: A pectin-rich layer that binds adjacent cell walls together.

### 3.2 Plant Cell Carbohydrates

Starch:  
Starch is a energy-storing polysaccharide composed of two molecules:

* Amylose: An unbranched chain of glucose molecules linked by 1,4 glycosidic bonds, forming a compact, coiled structure ideal for energy storage.  
* Amylopectin: A branched chain of glucose molecules connected by 1,4 and 1,6 glycosidic bonds. Its branching allows rapid enzymatic breakdown, releasing energy quickly.  
  Starch granules are formed by successive layers of these polysaccharides.

Cellulose:  
A key component of plant cell walls, cellulose consists of long, unbranched chains of beta glucose linked by glycosidic bonds. These chains form microfibrils through hydrogen bonding, providing structural support to plant cells.

### 3.3 The Secondary Cell Wall

The secondary cell wall forms between the primary cell wall and the cell membrane after the cell stops growing. It consists of parallel layers of cellulose microfibrils and additional polysaccharides, enhancing strength and flexibility. This structure makes plant cells useful for various human applications.

### 3.4 Sclerenchyma Fibres, Phloem, and Xylem Vessels

Lignin:  
A polysaccharide added to the secondary cell walls of xylem vessels and sclerenchyma fibres, lignin increases rigidity and strength.

* Xylem Vessels: Dead cells forming hollow tubes that transport water and inorganic ions throughout the plant.  
* Sclerenchyma Fibres: Dead cells with tapered ends, providing structural support.  
* Phloem: Living cells arranged end-to-end to form sieve tube elements, responsible for transporting organic solutes (translocation). Companion cells support phloem function.

In vascular bundles, xylem is located centrally, followed by phloem and sclerenchyma fibres on the outer side.

### 3.5 Sustainability

Plant materials are renewable and sustainable, as they can be regrown at the rate of consumption. Unlike non-renewable resources like crude oil, plants offer eco-friendly alternatives:

* Biodiesel: Produced from plant-derived ethanol, offering a sustainable fuel option.  
* Plant-Based Products: Strong and biodegradable materials like plant fibres can replace oil-based plastics, reducing waste and environmental impact.

Uses of Plant Fibres:

* Strong fibres are used to make ropes, fabrics, and other materials.  
* Plant-based production is cost-effective compared to oil-based alternatives.  
* Starch is used to produce bioplastics and bioethanol.  
* Plants like garlic and cinnamon have antimicrobial and therapeutic properties.

### 3.6 Water and Inorganic Ions

Xylem Function:  
The xylem transports water and inorganic ions absorbed by root hair cells to other parts of the plant.  
Importance of Water:

* Maintains cell turgor, preventing wilting.  
* Acts as a reactant in photosynthesis and hydrolysis reactions.  
* Facilitates the movement of dissolved ions through the transpiration stream.

Essential Ions for Plants:

* Nitrate Ions: Required for synthesizing nucleotide bases and amino acids.  
* Calcium Ions: Needed to form calcium pectate for the middle lamella.  
* Phosphate Ions: Essential for producing ADP and ATP.  
* Magnesium Ions: Crucial for chlorophyll production.

## 4\. Bacteria

### 4.1 Bacterial Growth

Under optimal conditions, bacterial populations can grow at an exponential rate, with some species capable of dividing every 20 minutes. The specific requirements for growth vary among bacteria, enabling them to thrive in diverse environments, including extreme locations like acidic lakes where other organisms cannot survive. Generally, the ideal conditions for bacterial growth include:

* Warmth: Promotes the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions.  
* Moisture: Essential for dissolving nutrients and facilitating chemical reactions.  
* Nutrients: Bacteria require ions (e.g., phosphate for ATP synthesis) and glucose for respiration, which they absorb from their surroundings.  
* Optimum pH: Ensures maximum efficiency of enzymatic activity.  
* Oxygen: Necessary for aerobic bacteria that rely on oxygen for respiration.
