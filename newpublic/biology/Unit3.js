# Unit 3: Practical Skills in Biology I  

## 1\. Core Practical 1: Estimating Concentrations of Reducing Sugars and Starch

* Objective: Use Benedict’s reagent and iodine solution to estimate concentrations of reducing sugars and starch using colour standards.  
* Benedict’s Test for Reducing Sugars:  
  * Independent Variable: Concentration of reducing sugar.  
  * Dependent Variable: Colour change of Benedict’s reagent.  
  * Method:  
    * Pipette 5 cm³ of the test solution into a test tube.  
    * Add 2 cm³ of Benedict’s reagent to the test tube.  
    * Place the test tube in a water bath set to 90°C for exactly 2 minutes.  
    * Remove the test tube and observe the colour change.  
  * Semi-Quantitative: The colour change from blue (negative) to brick-red (positive) indicates the concentration of reducing sugar. The intensity of the red colour corresponds to the concentration.  
* Iodine Test for Starch:  
  * Pipette 2 cm³ of the test solution into a test tube.  
  * Add 2 drops of potassium iodide solution.  
  * A colour change from brown to blue-black indicates the presence of starch.  
* Colour Standards:  
  * Prepare known concentrations of reducing sugars and starch.  
  * Perform the Benedict’s and iodine tests on these known concentrations to create a set of colour standards.  
  * Compare the colour of the unknown solution to these standards to estimate its concentration.  
* Risk Assessment:  
  * Hazards:  
    * Spillage of liquids can make surfaces slippery.  
    * Hot water bath can cause scalding.  
    * Glassware can break and cause cuts.  
  * Precautions:  
    * Wipe up spills immediately.  
    * Use tongs to handle hot test tubes.  
    * Handle glassware carefully and keep it away from the edge of the desk.

## 2\. Core Practical 2: Vitamin C Content in Food and Drink

* Objective: Determine the vitamin C concentration in fruit juices using DCPIP solution.  
* Method:  
  * Pipette 1 cm³ of DCPIP solution into a test tube.  
  * Fill a 5 cm³ syringe with 5 cm³ of vitamin C solution.  
  * Add the vitamin C solution drop by drop to the DCPIP solution, shaking gently after each addition.  
  * Stop adding the vitamin C solution when the DCPIP turns colourless.  
  * Record the volume of vitamin C solution added.  
  * Repeat the process with different fruit juices.

  * Remove the beetroot pieces and measure the absorbance of the solution using a colorimeter.  
* Results:  
  * Temperature Effects:  
    * Below 0°C: Ice crystals form and pierce the membrane, increasing permeability.  
    * 0°C-40°C: Increased kinetic energy causes phospholipids to move more, increasing permeability.  
    * Above 40°C: Proteins denature and membranes melt, significantly increasing permeability.  
  * Alcohol Effects: Higher concentrations of alcohol disrupt the membrane more, increasing permeability.

  * Hazards:  
    * Broken glass can cause cuts.  
    * Ethanol is flammable and volatile.
