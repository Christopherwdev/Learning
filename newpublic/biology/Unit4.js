## 1\. Photosynthesis

### 1.1 Overview of Photosynthesis

* Definition: The process by which green plants and some other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose.  
* Equation:  
  * 6CO₂ \+ 6H₂O \+ light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ \+ 6O₂.  
* Importance: Provides energy for nearly all life on Earth; forms the basis of food chains.

### Types of Organisms

* Autotrophic: Organisms that produce their own food, primarily through photosynthesis.  
  * Photosynthetic Organisms: Green plants, algae.  
* Heterotrophic: Organisms that obtain energy by consuming other organisms.

### ATP 

* Structure: Composed of adenine, ribose, and phosphate groups.  
* Function: Main energy carrier in cells.  
* Importance: ATP is produced in light-dependent reactions and used in light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).

### 1.2  Light-Dependent Reactions

* Location: Thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.  
* Process:  
  * Photon Absorption: Chlorophyll absorbs light energy (LE), exciting electrons.  
  * Photolysis: 2H₂O → 4H⁺ \+ 4e⁻ \+ O₂.  
    * Splitting of water molecules produces oxygen and replaces lost electrons in chlorophyll.  
  * Electron Transport Chain (ETC):  
    * Excited electrons move through a series of proteins, releasing energy.  
    * H⁺ ions accumulate in the thylakoid space.  
  * ATP Production:  
    * ADP \+ Pi \+ energy → ATP (via ATP synthase).  
    * H⁺ ions flow back into the stroma, driving ATP synthesis.  
  * NADPH Formation: H⁺ ions and electrons reduce NADP⁺ to NADPH, essential for the Calvin cycle.

### Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)

* Location: Stroma of chloroplasts.  
* Process:  
  * Carbon Fixation:  
    * CO₂ combines with ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) to form glycerate 3-phosphate (GP) (catalyzed by RUBISCO).  
  * Reduction Phase:  
    * GP → GALP using ATP and NADPH.  
    * GALP can be converted into glucose and other organic compounds.  
  * Regeneration Phase:

  * Equation: NPP \= GPP \- R, where R is respiration.  
* Net Primary Productivity (NPP): The rate at which light energy is stored in plant biomass in producers (that can be passed onto primary consumers/herbivores).  
  * NPP is transported to the ground through the phloem as sucrose and amino acids.  
* Factors Affecting GPP & NPP:  
  * Determined by light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, humidity, and other factors.  
  * GPP increases with greater mineral ion concentration in soil and a greater surface area on leaves to absorb light energy.  
  * Higher rates of photosynthesis lead to more growth and ATP generation in the light-dependent reactions (LDR) and more glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GALP) produced in the light-independent reactions (LIR).  
* Plant Growth:  
  * Cellulose Structure: Composed of beta glucose linked by 1,4 glycosidic bonds.  
  * Peptide Bond: Formed between carbon and nitrogen atoms.  
  * Growth and metabolism involve enzymes, with the temperature coefficient Q10Q\_{10}Q10​ defined as:  
     Q10=rate at higher temperaturerate at lower temperatureQ\_{10} \= \\frac{\\text{rate at higher temperature}}{\\text{rate at lower temperature}}Q10​=rate at lower temperaturerate at higher temperature​  
     where the temperature difference is 10°C.

  * Decreasing biodiversity can disrupt ecosystem stability.

### Ecosystem Dynamics

* Competition: Organisms compete for space, nutrients, and other resources, leading to distinct species distributions in different regions.  
* Predator-Prey Relationships: Predators and prey follow cyclical patterns; as predator populations increase, prey populations decrease, and vice versa.  
  * 

### Adaptation Mechanisms

* Types:  
  * Behavioral: Changes in behavior to enhance survival.  
  * Anatomical: Physical adaptations that improve survival chances.  
  * Physiological: Internal bodily functions that adapt to environmental pressures.

  * Composed of DNA.  
  * Have circular genetic material.  
  * DNA is double-stranded and can contain plasmids, which are small circles of additional DNA coding for specific traits.  
* Viruses:  
  * Can have either DNA or RNA.  
  * Their genetic material is typically linear and may be single-stranded (especially RNA).  
  * Viruses do not possess plasmids.

---

### 4.2 Skin Flora and Its Role

* Skin Flora:  
  * Comprises beneficial bacteria that inhabit the skin and outcompete pathogens for space and nutrients.  
  * They produce toxins that can kill harmful pathogens and prevent their growth or colonization, thus acting as a first line of defense against infections.

---

### 4.3 Tuberculosis (TB) and Its Pathophysiology

* Causative Agent: Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  
* Transmission: Primarily through droplet infection when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  
* Infection Mechanism:  
  1. TB bacteria are inhaled and engulfed by macrophages in the lungs.  
  2. These bacteria can form tubercles or granulomas, leading to persistent coughing and damage to lung tissue.  
  3. The immune response weakens, making the host susceptible to opportunistic infections.  
  4. Insufficient oxygen for aerobic respiration can lead to organ failure, including heart attacks.

---

### 4.4 HIV → AIDS: Mechanism of Infection

* Causative Agent: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).  
* Infection Process:  
  * Binding: The viral glycoprotein GP120 binds to CD4 receptors on T helper cells.  
  * Entry: The virus fuses with the cell membrane, allowing viral RNA and enzymes to enter the host cell.  
  * Reverse Transcription: Viral RNA is transcribed into DNA by reverse transcriptase.  
  * Integration: The viral DNA integrates into the host genome using integrase, leading to viral replication.  
* Impact on Immune System:  
  * Destroys T helper cells, reducing cytokine production and impairing B cell activation.  
  * Results in decreased antibody production, increasing vulnerability to opportunistic infections like TB and pneumonia.

---

### 4.5 Bacteria: Structure and Functions

* General Structure:  
  * All bacteria have a cell surface membrane and a nucleoid containing a single circular strand of DNA.  
  * Some bacteria possess additional structures:  
    * Flagella: For movement.  
    * Pili: For attachment to host cells.  
    * Capsule: A protective slime layer to prevent dehydration and evade immune detection.  
    * 70S Ribosomes: The site of protein synthesis.  
* Bacterial Proteins:  
  * Bacterial proteins differ from those of eukaryotes as bacteria lack a Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum, leading to improper modification and packaging, as well as potential incorrect folding or addition of groups.  
* Roles of Bacteria:  
  * Act as decomposers, breaking down organic matter.  
  * Protect skin and gut as natural flora.  
  * Assist in digestion, particularly in ruminants, by helping to break down cellulose.  
  * Some bacteria can act as pathogens, causing diseases.

### Bacterial Growth and Reproduction

* Reproduction: Bacteria reproduce asexually via binary fission, similar to mitosis.  
* Growth Phases:  
  1. Lag Phase: Microorganisms adapt to their environment, with no active division.  
  2. Log Phase: Microorganisms are actively dividing, leading to exponential growth.  
  3. Stationary Phase: Nutrients are depleted due to competition, and waste accumulates, stabilizing growth as new cells equal dying cells.  
  4. Death Phase: Death rate exceeds growth rate, indicating a decline in the population.  
* Graphical Representation: When illustrated on a straight-line graph, the y-axis should display the log number of living bacterial cells.

### Measurement Techniques in Bacterial Cultivation

* Measurement by Light Absorption:

  * Optical density determines total cell count. There is a positive correlation between the size of microorganisms and optical density, but at higher densities, there is more reflection of light, leading to inaccuracies.  
  * One calibration curve cannot be universally applied due to varying sizes of microorganisms affecting light reflection.  
* Measurement by Dilution Plating:

  * This method determines the living count and accounts for uneven distribution and ongoing reproduction.  
  * Serial dilution of drug solutions can be prepared, and soaked paper discs can be placed in wells on agar plates to measure the area of inhibition for antimicrobial effectiveness.

---

### 4.6 Viral Structure and Classification

* Structural Components:  
  * Capsid: The protein coat made of repeating units called capsomeres.  
  * Nucleic Acids: Can be DNA or RNA, which is either single or double-stranded.  
  * Envelope: A lipid membrane derived from host cells, present in some viruses, facilitating cell entry but making them vulnerable to certain substances.  
* Types of Viruses:  
  * DNA Viruses: Generally less harmful (e.g., Smallpox).  
  * RNA Viruses: More mutation-prone, leading to diverse strains (e.g., Influenza).  
  * Retroviruses: A subset of RNA viruses that utilize reverse transcriptase enzymes (e.g., HIV), allowing them to integrate their genetic material into the host genome.

---

### 4.7 Viral Lifecycles: Lytic vs. Lysogenic Pathways

* Lytic Pathway:  
  1. Attaches to the host membrane and injects DNA by penetrating through.  
  2. Viral DNA replicates independently within the host.  
  3. New virus particles are synthesized, leading to immediate lysis (destruction) of the host cell.  
  4. This rapid replication causes symptoms of viral infection as cells are destroyed.  
* Lysogenic Pathway:  
  1. Viral DNA integrates into the host cell DNA, remaining dormant (provirus).  
  2. Viral DNA replicates with the host DNA, but no immediate symptoms occur.  
  3. Under certain conditions, the virus can reactivate, entering the lytic cycle.

### How Viruses Cause Disease

* Viruses cause disease primarily through:  
  * Lysis of Host Cells: Destroying cells and releasing viral particles.  
  * Toxin Production: Some viruses induce the host to produce toxins that disrupt normal cellular functions.  
  * Immune System Evasion: By integrating into host DNA, viruses can evade immune detection and persist in the host.

---

### 4.8 Aseptic Techniques for Culture Control

* Importance:  
  * Aseptic techniques are vital to avoid contamination of cultures by other bacteria, which could overestimate results and compete for nutrients or produce toxins.  
  * Prevents the transfer of bacteria onto surroundings, which may be pathogenic.  
* Methods:  
  * Flame sterilization of equipment and minimizing the time lids are open to create an updraft that drives air microorganisms away from cultures.  
  * Maintaining sterile conditions through autoclaved equipment, disinfected work areas, and handwashing to eliminate any present bacteria.

### Viruses: Structures and Types

* Viral Types:

  * L. phage: Linear double-stranded DNA, infects bacteria, complex (asymmetrical) capsid, head and tail region, no envelope.  
  * HIV: Linear single-stranded RNA (2), spherical shape, polyhedral capsid, lipid envelope, GP120 glycoproteins.  
  * Ebola: Linear single-stranded RNA (1), elongated shape, helical capsid, envelope, various proteins, glycoproteins.  
  * TMV: Linear single-stranded RNA, spiral capsid, no envelope, fewer various proteins, no glycoproteins.  
* Comparative Structures:

  * Bacteria: Circular DNA, cell membrane/wall, cytoplasm/ribosomes, flagellum/pili/mesosomes/plasmids.  
  * Viruses: Linear DNA/RNA, capsid made of proteins, spikes for attachment.

---

### 4.9 Interactions Between TB and HIV

* Impact of HIV on TB:  
  * HIV weakens the immune system by destroying T helper cells, leading to a lack of antibodies and enzymes required to destroy infected cells.  
  * TB bacteria are not effectively destroyed by macrophages, and T helper cells are not activated, allowing TB to thrive.  
  * Tubercles form in the lungs, leading to reduced oxygen availability and switching respiration from aerobic to anaerobic.  
  * Death can result from high fever, liver damage, organ failure, and other opportunistic infections.

---

### 4.10 Treatment and Control of Infections

* TB Treatment: Diagnosis via chest X-rays and bacterial DNA analysis. Treatment involves a combination of antibiotics to prevent resistance and improve living standards to reduce transmission.  
* HIV Control: Preventive measures include safe sex practices and clean needle use, with current treatments focusing on anti-retroviral drugs to manage the infection but not cure it.

# 5\. Immunity and Antibiotics

---

### 5.1 Introduction to Immune Responses

* The body has multiple physical and chemical barriers to entry for pathogens, such as the skin and mucous membranes. However, some pathogens can bypass these defenses, necessitating immune responses, which can be classified as specific (adaptive) and non-specific (innate).

---

###  5.2 Cell Recognition and Antigens

* The immune system must recognize 'self' and 'non-self' cells by identifying different cell surface proteins.  
* Antigens are any molecules recognized as foreign by the immune system, including surface glycoproteins, toxins, and intact pathogens (viruses or bacteria) that stimulate an immune response. These antigens are recognized by white blood cells (leucocytes).

---

### 5.3 Leucocytes (White Blood Cells)

* Structure:

  * Larger than red blood cells (RBCs) and can change shape due to lobed nuclei, allowing them to squeeze through blood vessels.  
  * All leucocytes contain a nucleus and colorless cytoplasm; some are granular (can be stained) while others are not.  
  * Lymphocytes: Include T cells (involved in cell-mediated immunity) and B cells (involved in humoral immunity).

---

### 5.4 Non-Specific Immune Responses

* Inflammation:

  * Histamine is released from mast cells in response to tissue damage, leading to vasodilation (enlargement of blood vessels) and increased blood flow to the affected area.  
  * Increased permeability of capillary walls allows plasma and leukocytes to exit the bloodstream and enter tissues, causing localized swelling (oedema) and redness.  
  * Pain alerts the individual to injury, while warmth accelerates the recovery process by enhancing enzyme activity and cell division.  
* Fever:

  * The hypothalamus raises body temperature to inhibit pathogen reproduction and enhance immune system function. Bacterial infections typically cause a steady rise in temperature, while viral infections may cause temperature spikes during viral replication.  
* Phagocytosis:

  * Phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, play crucial roles. Neutrophils are quick responders but have limited lysosomes, while macrophages can digest many pathogens due to their abundant lysosomes.  
  * Phagocytes engulf pathogens, enclosing them in a phagosome that fuses with lysosomes to digest the pathogen. After engulfing pathogens, they produce and release cytokines, signaling molecules that attract other immune cells to the infection site.  
* Interferons:

  * Produced by infected cells, interferons are proteins that inhibit viral replication. They diffuse to nearby uninfected cells, binding to their receptors and preventing the viruses from entering, thereby stimulating resistance to infection.

---

### 5.5 Specific Immune Responses

* Overview:

  * Specific immune responses target specific pathogens, involving lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) and macrophages. Two pathways exist: Humoral (for pathogens in blood plasma) and Cell-mediated (for pathogens that have infected host cells).  
* Activation of Lymphocytes:

  * T Helper Cells: Inactive T helper cells are activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Activated T helper cells produce cytokines that stimulate B cells and T killer cells.  
  * B Cells: When activated by T helper cells, B cells differentiate into plasma cells (which produce antibodies) and memory B cells (which provide long-term immunity).

---

### 5.7 Humoral Immune Response

* Mechanism:

  * Macrophages engulf pathogens and present antigens on their surface, becoming APCs.  
  * Activated T helper cells stimulate B cells, leading to clonal expansion and differentiation into plasma cells and memory B cells.  
  * Plasma cells produce antibodies specific to the antigen.  
* Antibody Functions:

  * Agglutination: Antibodies bind to pathogens, causing them to clump together, which facilitates phagocytosis.  
  * Opsonization: Antibodies serve as markers for phagocytosis, enhancing the ability of macrophages to engulf pathogens.  
  * Neutralization: Antibodies bind to and neutralize toxins produced by pathogens.

### Cell-Mediated Immune Response

* Mechanism:  
  1. Infected or cancerous cells become APCs and present antigens to T killer cells.  
  2. T killer cells, activated by cytokines, undergo clonal expansion and differentiate into active T killer cells and memory T killer cells.  
  3. Active T killer cells bind to infected cells and release perforins, causing lysis and preventing the spread of the pathogen.

### Secondary Immune Response

* Upon re-exposure to the same antigen, memory cells rapidly differentiate into plasma cells, producing antibodies more quickly and in greater quantities than during the primary response, leading to a more robust immune reaction.

### 5.8 Types of Immunity

* Natural Active Immunity: Occurs when the body produces its own antibodies following exposure to pathogens.  
* Natural Passive Immunity: Antibodies are transferred from mother to fetus (via placenta or breastfeeding), providing temporary immunity without stimulating the immune system.  
* Artificial Active Immunity: Induced by vaccination, where weakened or inactive pathogens stimulate the immune response, resulting in memory cell production.  
* Artificial Passive Immunity: Involves the injection of pre-formed antibodies from one individual to another, providing temporary immunity without stimulating the recipient's immune system.

### 5.9 Antibiotics

* Definition: Antibiotics are substances produced by microorganisms (e.g., fungi) that inhibit the growth of bacteria or kill them.

* Mechanisms:

  * Selective Toxicity: Antibiotics target prokaryotic cells, affecting bacteria but not human cells due to the absence of specific target sites in eukaryotic cells.  
  * Classes:  
    * Bacteriostatic: Inhibit bacterial growth.  
    * Bactericidal: Kill bacteria, though they may not eliminate all pathogens entirely.  
* Effectiveness Factors:

  * The concentration of the drug, local pH, and the susceptibility of the pathogen to the antibiotic influence effectiveness. If the standard dose kills the pathogen, it is considered sensitive; if a higher dose is needed, the pathogen is moderately sensitive; if the pathogen is unaffected, it is considered resistant.

### Antibiotic Resistance

* Mechanism:  
  * The presence of antibiotics creates a selection pressure, allowing resistant bacteria to survive and reproduce. Mutations may lead to the production of enzymes that degrade antibiotics or modifications to target sites, resulting in decreased effectiveness of treatments.

### 5.10 Infection Prevention and Control

* Hospital-Acquired Infections (HAIs):

* Hand washing stations  
* Masks worn  
* Long sleeves/ ties/ watches not worn  
* Regular disinfection of bed surfaces, usage of sterile equipments  
* Disposal of equipment  
* Patients tested and quarantined

### 5.11 Herd Immunity

* Definition: Herd immunity occurs when a significant proportion of a population becomes immune to a pathogen, reducing the likelihood of infection in non-immune individuals, particularly through vaccination.  
* Importance: Vital for controlling or eradicating diseases, as the percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated varies based on the disease's infectiousness.

---

### 5.12 Evolution of Pathogens

* Virus Evolution: Vaccines stimulate immune responses that produce antibodies against specific viral proteins. However, mutations in viral RNA/DNA can alter the shape of these proteins, allowing the virus to evade immune detection.  
* Evolutionary Race: There is a constant evolutionary race between antibiotics and bacteria, as resistance mechanisms develop, necessitating the discovery of new drugs that are effective against resistant strains.

## 6\. Decomposition and Forensics

---

### 6.1 Microorganisms and Decomposition

* Role of Microorganisms:

  * Microorganisms, particularly bacteria and fungi, are critical decomposers in ecosystems.  
* Process of Decomposition:

  * Decomposer Action: Bacteria and fungi secrete extracellular enzymes (e.g., proteases, carbohydrases, cellulases) that break down complex organic compounds.  
    * For example, carbohydrases break glycosidic bonds in carbohydrates, hydrolyzing disaccharides using water molecules.  
  * Respiration: After digestion, microorganisms absorb the simpler organic molecules, such as glucose, through diffusion. They then respire these molecules, releasing carbon dioxide (CO₂) and ammonia (NH₃) into the atmosphere.  
  * Nutrient Recycling: The remaining simpler molecules are returned to the soil, enriching it and supporting plant growth.  
* Importance of Decomposition:

  * Nutrient Cycling: Vital for the carbon and nitrogen cycles, allowing plants to photosynthesize and maintaining ecosystem stability.  
  * Soil Fertility: Enhances soil fertility by replenishing minerals.  
  * Waste Management: Prevents the accumulation of dead organic matter.  
* Factors Affecting Decomposition:

  * Temperature: Increases kinetic energy, enhancing enzyme activity involved in decomposition.  
  * Oxygen Availability: Facilitates aerobic respiration, accelerating decay.  
  * Moisture: Aids in hydrolysis and prevents desiccation of decomposers.  
* Applications of Decomposition:

  * Utilized in sewage treatment and compost production, transforming waste into valuable nutrients.

### The Carbon Cycle

* Microorganisms play a crucial role in the carbon cycle by decomposing organic matter, releasing CO₂ during respiration, which is then used by plants for photosynthesis.

### 6.2 Dendrochronology

* Definition: The study of tree rings to determine historical climatic conditions and growth patterns.  
* Method:  
  * A tree trunk is removed, and the rings are counted, with one ring representing one year of growth.  
  * The width of the rings indicates the biomass gained each year, reflecting environmental conditions during growth.

### 6.3 Forensic Science and Estimation of Time of Death (TOD)

* Overview: Forensic science applies scientific techniques to investigate crimes, answering key questions about the identity, time, and cause of death.

* Estimating Time of Death (TOD):

  * Forensic scientists assess various factors alongside witness evidence to estimate TOD, as no single factor provides a definitive answer.

#### Body Temperature

* Normal Range: Typically maintained around 36-37°C.  
* Post-Mortem Cooling: After death, metabolic reactions slow, leading to a decrease in body temperature.  
  * The body cools at a predictable rate, initially slowly, then more rapidly until it equilibrates with ambient temperature.  
* Measurement:  
  * Core temperature can be measured using a temperature probe applied to the liver or rectally.  
* Factors Influencing Cooling:  
  * Fat Levels: Higher body fat provides insulation, slowing heat loss.  
  * Ambient Temperature: Affects the rate of heat loss; colder environments lead to faster cooling.  
  * Body Surface Area to Volume Ratio: Smaller individuals cool more quickly than larger ones.  
  * Clothing: Insulates the body, slowing heat loss.

#### Degree of Muscle Contraction (Rigor Mortis)

* Definition: Rigor mortis refers to the temporary stiffness of muscles after death due to biochemical changes.  
* Process:  
  * Following death, ATP reserves deplete, and muscle cells contract without the ability to relax.  
  * Rigor mortis typically begins 2-4 hours after death, peaks at 6-8 hours, and lasts 36-48 hours.  
* Factors Influencing Rigor Mortis:  
  * ATP Levels: Varying ATP levels at the time of death affect the onset of rigor.  
  * Temperature: Higher temperatures accelerate metabolism, depleting ATP more quickly.

#### Forensic Entomology

* Definition: The study of insect life cycles as they relate to estimating TOD.  
* Methodology:  
  * Insects colonize the body in a specific sequence; their life cycles vary with environmental conditions.

  * Blowflies are typically the first to arrive and lay eggs on decomposing bodies.

  * Indicators of Body Movement:

    * Certain insect species are specific to particular habitats. If non-native species are found, it suggests the body has been moved.  
    * Inconsistencies in insect life cycles (e.g., absence of expected larvae stages) can also indicate movement.

#### Stage of Succession and Decomposition

* Concept of Succession: The dead body serves as a new habitat, allowing ecological succession.  
* Stages of Decomposition:  
  * Initial Colonization: Anaerobic bacteria break down tissues, producing gases that can cause bloating.  
  * Active Insect Feeding: Blowfly larvae (maggots) consume flesh, reducing body mass.  
  * Further Colonization: Beetles and other organisms continue to feed on the remains, further decomposing the body.  
* Influencing Factors:  
  * Temperature: Higher temperatures increase decay rates through enhanced enzyme activity.  
  * Exposure Level: An exposed body decays faster due to accessibility for insects.

### 6.4 Techniques for Analyzing DNA and Forensic Applications

#### Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

* Definition: A technique used to amplify DNA samples, making enough DNA available for analysis.  
* Process:  
  1. DNA is mixed with Taq polymerase, primers, nucleotides, and buffer.  
  2. The mixture is subjected to cycles of heating (to separate strands), cooling (to allow primers to bind), and moderate heating (to synthesize new strands).  
  3. This cycle is repeated multiple times to produce numerous copies of the target DNA.

#### DNA Profiling

* Purpose: Used to create unique DNA profiles for individuals based on non-coding regions (introns) which vary between people.  
* Method:  
  1. DNA samples are extracted and amplified.  
  2. Restriction enzymes cut the DNA at specific sites, producing fragments of varying sizes.  
  3. Gel electrophoresis separates these fragments based on size, creating a distinct banding pattern that can be compared for identification.

### 6.5 Limitations of Forensic Methods

* Various factors can limit the accuracy of methods used to estimate TOD:  
  * Body temperature and rigor mortis can be influenced by ambient temperature.  
  * Rigor mortis has a limited duration and is somewhat subjective.  
  * Decomposition stages depend on environmental conditions, such as exposure and temperature.
