# Unit 6: Practical Skills in Biology II  

## 10\. Core Practical 10: Factors Affecting Photosynthesis

* # Objective: Investigate the effects of light intensity, light wavelength, temperature, and carbon dioxide availability on the rate of photosynthesis using an aquatic plant.

* # Method:

  * # Place pondweed in a beaker of water.

  * # Cover one side with aluminium foil and the other with a coloured light filter.

  * # Add sodium hydrogen carbonate to provide carbon dioxide.

  * # Place a bench lamp at a set distance and set up a photosynthometer.

  * # Record the volume of gas produced over time.

  * # Repeat with different light filters.

* # Results:

  * # The volume of gas produced is proportional to the rate of photosynthesis.

  * # No filter (white light) produces the most gas, as all wavelengths are absorbed.

  * # Green filters produce the least gas, as chloroplasts reflect green light.

* # Risk Assessment:

  * # Hazards: Biohazard contamination, lamp damage to eyes, sodium hydrogen carbonate irritation.

  * # Precautions: Use disinfectant, avoid direct lamp exposure, wear eye protection.

## 11\. Core Practical 11: Ecology of a Habitat

* # Objective: Study the distribution and abundance of organisms using quadrats and transects, and measure abiotic factors.

* # Methods:

  * # Quadrat Sampling:

    1. # Use a grid to randomly select 20 coordinates in an area.

    2. # Place a quadrat at each coordinate and record species abundance or percentage cover.

  * # Transect Sampling:

    1. # Lay a belt transect across an environmental gradient (e.g., shade to sunlight).

    2. # Place a quadrat every 2 metres and record species abundance and abiotic factors (e.g., light intensity).

* # Risk Assessment:

  * # Hazards: Thorns, allergies, dirt, slipping, sunburn.

  * # Precautions: Clean cuts, inform teachers of allergies, wear gloves, use sun protection.

* # Analysis:

  * # Use Spearman’s rank correlation for transect data.

  * # Use Student’s t-test to compare quadrat data.

## 12\. Core Practical 12: Effect of Temperature on Organism Development

* # Objective: Investigate the effect of temperature on the development of organisms (e.g., brine shrimp hatching or seedling growth).

* # Method (Brine Shrimp):

  * # Prepare beakers with saltwater at different temperatures (15°C, 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C).

  * # Add brine shrimp eggs and incubate for 24 hours.

  * # Count the number of hatched shrimp.

* # Method (Seedlings):

  * # Place seedlings in petri dishes with cotton wool and water.

  * # Incubate at different temperatures for 5 days.

  * # Count the number of germinated seeds.

* # Risk Assessment:

  * # Hazards: Allergies, glass cuts, ethanol flammability.

  * # Precautions: Wear gloves, handle glass carefully, avoid open flames.

* # Conclusion: Higher temperatures generally increase development rates up to an optimal point.

## 13\. Core Practical 13: Growth of Microorganisms

* # Objective: Investigate the rate of growth of microorganisms (e.g., yeast) in a liquid culture.

* # Method:

  * # Prepare a yeast culture with glucose solution.

  * # Incubate at room temperature.

  * # Measure turbidity using a colorimeter or light sensor at intervals (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).

* # Risk Assessment:

  * # Hazards: Contamination, allergic reactions, glass cuts.

  * # Precautions: Use aseptic techniques, wear gloves, handle glass carefully.

* # Results: Plot a graph of absorbance against time to show exponential growth.

#### 14\. Core Practical 14: Effect of Antibiotics on Bacteria

* # Objective: Investigate the effectiveness of different antibiotics on bacterial growth.

* # Method:

  * # Spread bacteria evenly on an agar plate.

  * # Place antibiotic-soaked filter paper discs on the plate.

  * # Incubate at 25°C for 48 hours.

  * # Measure the diameter of inhibition zones.

* # Risk Assessment:

  * # Hazards: Bacterial infection, skin irritation from disinfectants.

  * # Precautions: Use aseptic techniques, wear gloves, avoid contamination.

* # Conclusion: Larger inhibition zones indicate more effective antibiotics.

## 15\. Core Practical 15: Respiration in Yeast

* # Objective: Use a redox indicator (TTC) to investigate the rate of respiration in yeast at different temperatures.

* # Method:

  * # Prepare a yeast suspension with glucose.

  * # Add TTC solution and incubate at different temperatures (15°C, 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C).

  * # Record the time taken for the solution to turn red.

* # Risk Assessment:

  * # Hazards: TTC irritation, glass cuts, liquid spills.

  * # Precautions: Avoid skin contact, handle glass carefully, wipe spills.

* # Results: Plot a graph of temperature against time or rate of reaction.

* # Method:

  * # Set up a respirometer with soda lime or potassium hydroxide to absorb CO₂.

  * # Place organisms in the respirometer and measure the movement of coloured fluid in the manometer.

  * # Calculate oxygen uptake and respiration rate.

* # Risk Assessment:
