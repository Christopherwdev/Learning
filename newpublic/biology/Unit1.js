## 1\.  Biological Molecules

### 1.1  Water

* Water as a Solvent:  
  * The oxygen atom in water attracts electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms, leading to an uneven distribution of electrons.  
  * This creates a slight negative charge near the oxygen and a slight positive charge near the hydrogens, making water a polar molecule.  
  * This polarity allows water to dissolve many substances, such as inorganic ions, enabling chemical reactions to occur.

### 1.2 Carbohydrates

* Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, forming chains of sugar units called saccharides.  
* Types of Saccharides:  
  * Monosaccharides:  
    * These are the simplest form of carbohydrates (e.g., glucose).  
    * They are small, water-soluble molecules.  
    * Example: Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆), a key molecule used in respiration.  
  * Disaccharides:  
    * Formed when two monosaccharides join through a condensation reaction.  
    * Examples:  
      * Maltose (two glucose molecules).  
      * Sucrose (glucose \+ fructose).  
      * Lactose (glucose \+ galactose).  
  * Polysaccharides:  
    * Long chains of monosaccharides, primarily used for energy storage.  
    * Properties:  
      * Large and compact molecules.  
      * Insoluble in water, preventing osmotic effects in cells.  
      * Can be broken down into glucose for energy release.  
    * Examples:  
      * Glycogen: The main energy storage molecule in animals, highly branched for quick energy access.  
      * Starch: The primary energy store in plants, made up of:  
        * Amylose: Unbranched chains of glucose, coiled for compact storage.  
        * Amylopectin: Branched chains of glucose, allowing rapid digestion.  
* Glycosidic Bonds:

  * These bonds form between monosaccharides during condensation reactions.  
  * They are broken during hydrolysis, which involves adding water to split the molecules.

### 1.3 Lipids

* Lipids are non-polar molecules, insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents.  
* Functions: Energy storage, organ protection, thermal insulation, and forming cell membranes.  
* Types of Lipids:  
  * Saturated Lipids:  
    * Contain no carbon-carbon double bonds (e.g., animal fats).  
  * Unsaturated Lipids:  
    * Contain carbon-carbon double bonds (e.g., plant oils), melting at lower temperatures.  
* Triglycerides:  
  * Made of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids, joined by ester bonds formed in condensation reactions.  
  * Used as long-term energy reserves in plants and animals.

## 2\. Circulatory system

### 2.1 The Need for a Circulatory System

* Diffusion Rate Formula:  
  Diffusion rate \= (concentration gradient × surface area) / distance  
* Large Animals:  
  * Have a small surface area to volume (SA:V ) ratio.  
  * High metabolic demands cannot be met by simple diffusion alone.  
* Circulatory System:  
  * Required for efficient exchange of nutrients and oxygen.  
  * A double circulatory system separates oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, enhancing concentration gradients and diffusion rates.

### 2.2 The heart structure

![][image1]

* Identifiable Features:  
  - Aorta: Arched structure at the top with smaller branching vessels.  
  - Vena Cava: Vertical tube on the side, divided into upper and lower parts by the heart.  
  - Pulmonary Vein: Two vessels on each side, usually located behind the heart.  
  - Pulmonary Artery: Two vessels (one on each side) above the pulmonary vein, arching over the aorta.

### 2.3 Blood Vessels

* Arteries:  
  * Carry blood away from the heart (e.g., aorta, pulmonary artery).  
  * Structure:  
    * Small lumen to maintain blood pressure.  
    * Thick walls with collagen to withstand pressure.  
    * Smooth endothelium to reduce friction.  
    * Elastic tissue to stretch and recoil, smoothing blood pressure fluctuations.  
    * Muscle cells to contract and maintain pressure.  
* Veins:  
  * Carry blood to the heart (e.g., vena cava, pulmonary vein).  
  * Structure:  
    * Valves to prevent backflow.  
* Capillaries:  
  * Site of exchange between arteries and veins.  
  * Structure:  
    * Branch extensively for a large surface area.  
    * Single layer of endothelial cells for short diffusion distance.  
    * Narrow lumen to slow blood flow, increasing diffusion time.  
    * Pores for exchange.

### 2.4 The Cardiac Cycle

* Circulation Flow:  
  Right chamber → Pulmonary artery → Lungs → Pulmonary vein → Left chamber → Aorta → Systemic circulation → Vena cava → Right chamber → …

### 2.5 Mechanism of Exchange

* Nutrient/Oxygen/Carbon Dioxide Exchange:  
  * Occurs between capillaries and body tissues or lungs.  
  * In Lungs:  
    * Oxygen diffuses from lung air sacs into capillaries.  
    * Carbon dioxide diffuses from capillaries into lung air sacs.  
  * Breathing:  
    * Increases oxygen and decreases carbon dioxide in lungs, creating a large concentration gradient.  
  * Air Sacs and Capillaries:  
    * Small size and large numbers provide a large surface area.  
    * Thin walls ensure a short diffusion distance.2.6 Mechanism of Carrying Oxygen

### 2.6 Mechanism of Carrying Oxygen

* Haemoglobin:  
  * Each molecule has four iron atoms, binding to four oxygen molecules.  
* ![][image2]  
* Carbon Dioxide Transport:  
  - Combines with haemoglobin.  
  - Carried in plasma as a solution.  
  - Transported as hydrogencarbonate ions:  
    * CO₂ enters red blood cells, combines with water to form carbonic acid.  
    * Carbonic acid dissociates into hydrogencarbonate ions and protons.  
    * Haemoglobin acts as a buffer.  
* Bohr Effect:  
  - Oxygen saturation decreases with increased carbon dioxide partial pressure.

### 2.7 Clotting

* Process:  
  - Damaged tissues release platelets, which release thromboplastin.  
  - Thromboplastin converts prothrombin to thrombin.  
  - Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin.  
  - Fibrin forms a clot.  
* Key Components:  
  - Thromboplastin: Soluble enzyme.  
  - Prothrombin: Soluble precursor.  
  - Thrombin: Soluble enzyme.  
  - Fibrinogen: Soluble precursor.  
  - Fibrin: Insoluble clot material.

### 2.8 Atherosclerosis & Thrombosis

* Process:  
  * Damage to artery endothelium triggers inflammation.  
  * Cholesterol builds up, forming an atheroma.  
  * Fibrous tissue and calcium salts harden the atheroma into a plaque.  
  * Artery lumen narrows (atherosclerosis).  
  * Severe damage causes clotting, blocking the lumen (thrombosis).  
* Effects:  
  * Reduced blood flow and increased blood pressure.  
  * Switch to anaerobic respiration, producing lactic acid.  
  * Insufficient oxygen for metabolic activities.  
  * Examples: Stroke, heart attack.

## 3\. Diet and Health

### 3.1 Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD)

### Atherosclerosis

1. Definition:  
   1. Atherosclerosis is the hardening of arteries caused by the build-up of fibrous plaque, known as an atheroma.  
2. Process of Atheroma Formation:  
   1. Endothelial Damage:  
      * The endothelium lining the arteries is damaged, for example, by high cholesterol, smoking, or high blood pressure.  
   2. Inflammatory Response:  
      * This triggers white blood cells to move into the artery.  
   3. Plaque Build-Up:  
      * Over time, cholesterol, calcium salts, fibres, and white blood cells accumulate and harden, forming plaque.  
   4. Artery Narrowing:  
      * The plaque narrows the artery, restricting blood flow and increasing blood pressure, which further damages the endothelium, repeating the cycle.

### Blood Clotting

1. Purpose:  
   1. Blood clots form to minimize blood loss from damaged vessels and prevent pathogens from entering the bloodstream.  
2. Thrombosis:  
   1. When clots form inside blood vessels, they can block blood flow, leading to cardiovascular disease.  
3. Process of Clot Formation:  
   1. Platelet Activation:  
      * Platelets change shape and clump together to form a temporary plug at the site of damage.  
   2. Clotting Factors:  
      * Thromboplastin is released, converting prothrombin into thrombin.  
   3. Fibrin Formation:  
      * Thrombin converts fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, which forms a mesh to trap blood cells and create a clot.

### 3.2 Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease

1. Definition of Risk:  
   * Risk is the chance of an unfavourable event occurring.  
2. Risk Factors:  
   * Genetics:  
     * Certain genes can increase the risk, such as those for high blood pressure or a family history of CVD.  
   * Diet:  
     * Diets high in cholesterol and saturated fats promote plaque formation.  
   * Age:  
     * The prevalence of CVD increases with age.  
   * High Blood Pressure:  
     * This can damage arteries and increase the risk of CVD.  
   * Smoking:  
     * Smoking damages artery linings and encourages atheroma formation.  
   * Inactivity:  
     * Lack of exercise is linked to higher blood pressure.  
3. Reducing Risk:  
   * Stopping smoking, exercising regularly, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy diet and weight can lower the risk.

### 3.3 Dietary Antioxidants

1. Oxidative Stress:  
   * This occurs when there is an imbalance between antioxidants and free radicals (reactive oxygen atoms with uneven electrons).  
2. Role of Antioxidants:  
   * Antioxidants donate electrons to stabilize free radicals, preventing damage to cells.  
3. Impact on CVD:  
   * Antioxidants may reduce oxidative stress, potentially lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### 3.4 Blood Cholesterol Levels and CVD

1. Lipoproteins:  
   * High-Density Lipoproteins (HDLs):  
     * Transport cholesterol to the liver for excretion, reducing cholesterol levels.  
     * Found in unsaturated fats and proteins.  
   * Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDLs):  
     * Transport cholesterol to arteries, where it can build up and form plaque.  
     * Found in saturated fats and proteins.  
2. Correlation:  
   * A high intake of saturated fats increases LDL levels, raising cholesterol and the risk of CVD.

### 3.5 Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases

1. Antihypertensives:  
   * Drugs that lower blood pressure.  
   * Pros: Generally effective and inexpensive.  
   * Cons: Side effects vary depending on the drug type.  
2. Statins:  
   * Drugs that lower cholesterol and reduce plaque formation.

   * Cons: May cause nausea, muscle aches, or, in rare cases, diabetes.  
3. Anticoagulants:  
   * Drugs that prevent blood clots.  
   * Pros: Reduce the risk of thrombosis.  
   * Cons: Increase the risk of excessive bleeding.  
4. Platelet Inhibitors:  
   * Drugs that interrupt the clotting cascade, preventing clot formation.  
   * Pros: Effective in preventing clots in specific arteries.  
   * Cons: Can lead to excessive bleeding.

2. Correlation:  
   * Describes the relationship between two variables.  
   * Values:  
     * 1: Perfect positive correlation (both variables increase together).  
     * 0: No correlation.  
     * \-1: Perfect negative correlation (one variable increases while the other decreases).  
   * Example: Positive correlation between cholesterol levels and CVD cases.  
3. Causation:  
   * When one variable directly causes another.  
   * Difference from Correlation:  
     * Correlation does not imply causation.  
   * Example:  
     * Causation: High cholesterol causes plaque formation.  
     * Correlation Only: Average temperatures in two locations increase simultaneously, but one does not cause the other.

### 3.8 Evaluating Studies

1. Sample Selection:  
   * Must be random to avoid bias.  
   * Should have a large enough sample size to represent the whole population.  
   * Must include samples from different areas (e.g., nationwide studies should not focus on one city).  
2. Reliability:  
   * Studies should include statistical analysis and undergo peer review.  
3. Clinical Trials:  
   * Should have:  
     * A control group.  
     * A placebo.  
     * Blind or double-blind procedures to avoid bias.

     1. mRNA attaches to a ribosome.  
     2. tRNA molecules carry amino acids to the ribosome.  
        * Each tRNA has an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon.  
     3. Two tRNA molecules bind to mRNA, and their amino acids form a peptide bond.  
     4. tRNA detaches, leaving the growing polypeptide chain.  
     5. The process repeats until a stop codon is reached.

## 7\. Inheritance

### 7.1 Genetic Mutations

1. Impact of Mutations:  
   * Errors in DNA replication can alter the amino acid sequence of proteins, affecting their structure and function.  
   * Non-Functional Proteins: May lead to diseases like cancer, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell anemia.  
2. Types of Mutations:  
   * Substitution:  
     * One base is replaced by another (e.g., ATGGCA → ATCGCA).  
     * May or may not change the amino acid due to the degenerate genetic code.  
   * Insertion:  
     * An extra base is added (e.g., GGCTAC → GGCTTTAC).  
     * Causes a frameshift, altering all subsequent codons.  
   * Deletion:  
     * A base is removed (e.g., TGCAAC → TGAAC).  
     * Also causes a frameshift, leading to non-functional proteins.  
3. Non-Coding DNA (Introns):  
   * Mutations in introns often have no effect as they do not code for proteins.

     * Homozygous Dominant (BB) × Homozygous Recessive (bb):  
       * All offspring have brown eyes (Bb).  
     * Heterozygous (Bb) × Heterozygous (Bb):  
       * Phenotype ratio: 3 brown eyes : 1 blue eyes.  
     * Heterozygous (Bb) × Homozygous Recessive (bb):  
       * Phenotype ratio: 1 brown eyes : 1 blue eyes.

### 7.3 Genetic Pedigree Diagrams

* Family trees showing the inheritance of genetic disorders.  
* Used to determine genotypes and predict the likelihood of passing on disorders.  
* Example: If two parents with a dominant trait have a child with a recessive trait, both parents must be heterozygous.

### 7.4 Sex-Linked Characteristics

1. Sex Chromosomes:  
   * Females: XX.  
   * Males: XY (Y chromosome is smaller and contains fewer genes).  
2. Sex-Linked Disorders:  
   * More common in males as they have only one X chromosome.  
   * Example: Red-green color blindness (8% of men, 0.5% of women).

### 7.5 Cystic Fibrosis

1. Cause:  
   * A recessive allele on chromosome 7 produces a non-functional CFTR protein.  
2. Effects:  
   * Gaseous Exchange:  
     * Thick mucus traps pathogens, leading to infections.  
   * Reproduction:  
     * Thick mucus reduces fertility in both men and women.  
   * Digestion:  
     * Blocked pancreatic duct reduces enzyme release, affecting nutrient absorption.

### 7.6 Genetic Screening

1. Purpose:  
   * Testing DNA for genetic disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis).  
2. Applications:  
   * Carrier Identification:  
     * Detects individuals with one recessive allele who can pass on the disorder.  
   * Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD):  
     * Screens embryos during IVF to select healthy ones.  
   * Prenatal Testing:  
     * Tests for disorders in a growing fetus.  
     * Methods: Amniocentesis (amniotic fluid) and Chorionic Villus Sampling (placental cells).

### 7.7 Ethics of Genetic Screening

1. Religious Perspectives:  
   * Some view life as sacred and oppose screening or abortion.  
   * Others prioritize the mother’s life over the fetus.  
2. Moral Concerns:  
   * Risk of false-positive or false-negative results leading to unnecessary abortions.  
   * Debate over quality of life vs. the right to life.  
3. Social Implications:  
   * May perpetuate discrimination against disabled individuals.  
   * Increases public awareness of genetic disorders.  
4. Other Ethical Issues:  
   * Risk of miscarriage during testing.  
   * Emotional and financial challenges of raising a child with a genetic disorder.
