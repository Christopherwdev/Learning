# Unit 1: Structure, Bonding and Introduction to Organic Chemistry

## 1\. Formulae, Equations and Amount of Substance

### 1.1 Chemical Terms and Definitions

* Key terms:  
  * Atom: The smallest part of an element that can exist  
  * Element: A substance made up of only one type of atom  
  * Ion: An atom or group of atoms with a positive or negative charge  
  * Molecule: A group of atoms bonded together  
  * Compound: A substance formed when two or more elements are chemically combined  
  * Empirical formula: The simplest whole number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound  
  * Molecular formula: The actual number of atoms of each element in a molecule

### 1.2 The Mole Concept

* The mole (mol) is the unit for amount of substance  
* One mole contains 6.02 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro constant, L)  
* Relative atomic mass (A\_r) is based on the ¹²C scale where carbon-12 is defined as exactly 12  
* Relative molecular/formula mass (M\_r) is calculated by adding the relative atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule/formula  
* Molar mass is the mass per mole of a substance in g mol⁻¹

### 1.3 Chemical Calculations

* Concentration of solutions can be calculated in:

  * mol dm⁻³ \= amount of solute (mol) ÷ volume of solution (dm³)  
  * g dm⁻³ \= mass of solute (g) ÷ volume of solution (dm³)  
* Empirical formula calculations:

  * Convert mass to moles (divide by molar mass)  
  * Find the simplest whole number ratio  
* Reacting masses:

  * Use balanced equations to calculate masses of reactants/products  
  * moles \= mass (g) ÷ molar mass (g mol⁻¹)  
* Gas volumes:

  * At RTP (room temperature and pressure), one mole of any gas occupies about 24 dm³  
  * Using the ideal gas equation: pV \= nRT

### 1.4 Yields and Atom Economy

* Percentage yield:

  * (Actual yield ÷ Theoretical yield) × 100%  
* Atom economy:

  * (Molar mass of desired product ÷ Sum of molar masses of all products) × 100%  
  * Measures efficiency in terms of atoms used

* Atomic (proton) number (Z): Number of protons in the nucleus

* Mass number (A): Sum of protons and neutrons

* Isotopes: Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons

  * Non-metal atoms gain electrons to form anions  
  * Strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions  
* Factors affecting ionic bond strength:

  * Ionic charge (higher charge \= stronger bond)  
  * Ionic radius (smaller radius \= stronger bond)

  * Dative covalent (coordinate) bond: Both electrons donated by one atom  
* Carbon structures:

  * Diamond: Tetrahedral arrangement, very hard  
  * Graphite: Layers of hexagonal rings, conducts electricity  
  * Graphene: Single layer of graphite, excellent conductor  
* Electronegativity:

  * Measure of an atom's attraction for bonding electrons  
  * Leads to bond polarity when atoms of different electronegativities bond  
  * Very large electronegativity differences result in ionic bonding

### 3.3 Shapes of Molecules

* Electron-pair repulsion theory:

  * Pairs of electrons around an atom repel each other  
  * Arrange themselves to minimize repulsion  
  * Determines the shape of molecules
