  * Evaluating risks and implementing controls  
  * Selecting appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)

### 22.2 Qualitative Analysis

* Tests for inorganic ions:

  * Cations: Flame tests, precipitation reactions, complex formation  
  * Anions: Precipitation, gas evolution, redox reactions  
* Tests for organic functional groups:

  * Alkenes: Bromine water (decolorization)  
  * Alcohols: PCl₅ (steamy fumes), oxidation tests  
  * Aldehydes: Fehling's/Benedict's solution, Tollens' reagent  
  * Ketones: 2,4-DNPH, iodoform test (methyl ketones only)  
  * Carboxylic acids: NaHCO₃ (effervescence), pH  
  * Esters: Hydrolysis followed by alcohol/acid tests  
  * Amines: With HCl (white fumes with 1° amines)

### 22.3 Quantitative Analysis

* Redox titrations:

  * KMnO₄: Self-indicating, sharp end-point
