# Unit 2: Energetics, Group Chemistry, Halogenoalkanes and Alcohols  

## 6\. Energetics

### 6.1 Enthalpy Changes

* Enthalpy change (ΔH):

  * Heat energy change measured at constant pressure  
  * Standard conditions: 100 kPa and 298 K  
  * Exothermic reactions: ΔH is negative, release energy  
  * Endothermic reactions: ΔH is positive, absorb energy  
* Types of enthalpy changes:

  * Standard enthalpy change of reaction (ΔₕH°): For a chemical reaction  
  * Standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔₛH°): Forming 1 mole of compound from elements  
  * Standard enthalpy change of combustion (ΔₖH°): Complete combustion of 1 mole  
  * Standard enthalpy change of neutralization (ΔₙₑᵤₜH°): Acid \+ base → salt \+ water  
  * Standard enthalpy change of atomization (ΔₐₜH°): Gaseous atoms from element

### 6.2 Measuring Enthalpy Changes

* Experimental methods:

  * Calorimetry: Measure temperature change in insulated container  
  * Energy transferred (J) \= mass (g) × specific heat capacity (J g⁻¹ °C⁻¹) × temperature change (°C)  
  * Convert to kJ mol⁻¹ by dividing by moles of limiting reactant  
* Hess's Law:

  * Enthalpy change is independent of route taken  
  * Allows calculation of enthalpy changes that cannot be measured directly  
  * Used in enthalpy cycles

### 6.3 Bond Enthalpies

* Bond enthalpy:

  * Energy required to break one mole of a particular bond  
  * Average values used for same bond in different molecules (mean bond enthalpy)  
* Calculating enthalpy changes:

  * ΔH \= Σ(bonds broken) \- Σ(bonds formed)  
  * Bonds broken (endothermic) have positive values  
  * Bonds formed (exothermic) have negative values  
* Limitations:

  * Uses average values, so less accurate than direct measurement  
  * Doesn't account for intermolecular forces  
* Predicting reactions:

  * Weaker bonds break more easily  
  * Bond enthalpy data helps predict which bonds break first in reactions

## 7\. Intermolecular Forces

### 7.1 Types of Intermolecular Forces

* London forces (dispersion forces):

  * Instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions  
  * Present between all molecules  
  * Strength increases with number of electrons (molar mass)  
* Permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions:

  * Between polar molecules  
  * Stronger than London forces  
* Hydrogen bonding:

  * Special case of strong dipole-dipole interaction  
  * Occurs when H is bonded to highly electronegative atoms (F, O, N)  
  * Particularly important in H₂O, NH₃, HF

### 7.2 Effects of Hydrogen Bonding

* Water properties due to hydrogen bonding:  
  * High melting and boiling points compared to similar molecules  
  * Lower density of ice compared to liquid water (ice floats)  
  * High surface tension  
  * High heat capacity

### 7.3 Physical Properties and Intermolecular Forces

* Boiling points:  
  * Alkanes: Increase with chain length (more London forces)  
  * Branched alkanes: Lower than straight-chain (less surface contact)  
  * Alcohols: Higher than alkanes with similar electrons (hydrogen bonding)  
  * Hydrogen halides: HF \> HCl \> HBr \> HI (hydrogen bonding in HF)

### 7.4 Solubility

* Solvent choice factors:  
  * "Like dissolves like" principle  
  * Water dissolves:  
    * Ionic compounds (via ion-dipole interactions)  
    * Simple alcohols (via hydrogen bonding)  
  * Water is poor solvent for non-polar compounds  
  * Non-aqueous solvents dissolve substances with similar intermolecular forces

## 8\. Redox Chemistry and Groups 1, 2 and 7

### 8.1 Redox Chemistry

* Oxidation number:

  * Charge an atom would have if electrons in bonds were assigned to more electronegative atom  
  * Rules for assigning:  
    * Free elements \= 0  
    * Monatomic ions \= charge on ion  
    * Oxygen usually \-2 (except in peroxides, \-1)  
    * Hydrogen usually \+1 (except in metal hydrides, \-1)  
    * Sum of oxidation numbers equals charge on species  
* Oxidation and reduction:

  * Oxidation: Loss of electrons, increase in oxidation number  
  * Reduction: Gain of electrons, decrease in oxidation number  
  * OIL RIG: Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain  
* Redox agents:

  * Oxidizing agent: Gains electrons (is reduced)  
  * Reducing agent: Loses electrons (is oxidized)

## 9\. Introduction to Kinetics and Equilibria

### 9.1 Kinetics

* Collision theory:

  * Reaction occurs when particles collide with sufficient energy  
  * Activation energy (Eₐ): Minimum energy needed for successful collision  
* Factors affecting rate:

  * Concentration: More particles, more collisions  
  * Temperature: Higher temperature, more energetic collisions  
  * Pressure: For gases, increases collision frequency  
  * Surface area: For solids, increases exposure to reactants  
  * Catalysts: Provide alternative reaction pathway with lower Eₐ  
* Measuring rates:

  * Rate \= 1/time for a reaction  
  * Rate \= gradient of tangent on concentration-time graph  
* Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:

  * Shows distribution of molecular energies at a given temperature  
  * Only molecules with energy ≥ Eₐ can react  
  * Increasing temperature shifts curve, more molecules exceed Eₐ  
* Catalysts:

  * Lower Eₐ by providing alternative reaction pathway  
  * Not consumed in the reaction  
  * Make processes more sustainable (less energy, higher atom economy)

### 9.2 Equilibria

* Dynamic equilibrium:

  * Forward and backward reactions occur at equal rates  
  * Concentrations remain constant  
  * Closed system required  
* Le Chatelier's Principle:

  * System responds to oppose changes in conditions  
* Effect of changes:

  * Concentration:  
    * Increase a reactant: Equilibrium shifts to use it up (right)  
    * Increase a product: Equilibrium shifts to use it up (left)  
  * Pressure (for reactions involving gases):  
    * Increase: Equilibrium shifts to side with fewer gas molecules  
    * Decrease: Equilibrium shifts to side with more gas molecules  
  * Temperature:  
    * Increase: Equilibrium shifts in endothermic direction  
    * Decrease: Equilibrium shifts in exothermic direction  
  * Catalyst: No effect on position of equilibrium (only rate)  
* Industrial considerations:

  * Compromise between yield (equilibrium position) and rate  
  * Economic factors often favor faster reactions over maximum yield
