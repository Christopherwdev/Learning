## 17\. Redox Equilibria

### 17.1 Electrode Potentials

* Standard electrode potential (E°):

  * Potential difference between electrode and solution containing its ions  
  * Measured under standard conditions:  
    * 298 K  
    * 100 kPa pressure  
    * 1.00 mol dm⁻³ concentration  
* Standard hydrogen electrode (SHE):

  * Reference electrode (defined as 0.00 V)  
  * Platinum in 1 mol dm⁻³ H⁺ with H₂ gas at 100 kPa  
* Cell diagrams:

  * Oxidation at left electrode, reduction at right  
  * E.g., Zn|Zn²⁺||Cu²⁺|Cu  
* Standard cell emf:

  * E°\_cell \= E°\_right \- E°\_left  
  * E°\_cell \= E°\_reduction \- E°\_oxidation

### 17.2 Predictions from Electrode Potentials

* Thermodynamic feasibility:

  * Reaction spontaneous if E°\_cell is positive  
  * More positive \= more feasible  
* Limitations:

  * Only predicts thermodynamic feasibility, not kinetics  
  * Only applies under standard conditions  
  * Some reactions have significant activation energy  
* Relation to equilibrium:

  * E°\_cell ∝ ln K (equilibrium constant)  
  * E°\_cell ∝ ΔS\_total (total entropy change)  
* Disproportionation:

  * Occurs when same element is oxidized and reduced  
  * Feasible if E° of higher oxidation state \> E° of lower oxidation state

### 17.3 Redox Titrations

* Common titrations:

  * Fe²⁺ with KMnO₄ (self-indicating)  
  * Na₂S₂O₃ with I₂ (starch indicator)  
* Calculations:

  * Use balanced equations to determine amounts  
  * For KMnO₄: MnO₄⁻ \+ 8H⁺ \+ 5e⁻ → Mn²⁺ \+ 4H₂O  
  * For I₂: I₂ \+ 2S₂O₃²⁻ → 2I⁻ \+ S₄O₆²⁻

### 17.4 Fuel Cells

* Principle:

  * Convert chemical energy directly to electrical energy  
  * More efficient than combustion  
* Hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell:

  * Anode: H₂ → 2H⁺ \+ 2e⁻  
  * Cathode: ½O₂ \+ 2H⁺ \+ 2e⁻ → H₂O  
  * Overall: H₂ \+ ½O₂ → H₂O  
* Advantages:

  * Clean (only product is water)  
  * Higher efficiency than combustion engines  
  * No moving parts

## 18\. Transition Metals and their Chemistry

### 18.1 Electronic Configuration and Properties

* Definition:

  * d-block elements that form one or more stable ions with incompletely-filled d-orbitals

  * Exceptions: Cr (\[Ar\]3d⁵ 4s¹) and Cu (\[Ar\]3d¹⁰ 4s¹)  
  * When forming ions, 4s electrons lost before 3d  
* Variable oxidation states:

  * Due to similar energies of 3d and 4s orbitals  
  * Different oxidation states have different properties

### 18.2 Complex Ions

* Definition:

  * Central metal ion surrounded by ligands  
  * Ligand: Molecule/ion with lone pair of electrons  
  * Dative covalent (coordinate) bond: Both electrons from ligand  
* Coordination number:

  * Number of coordinate bonds to central metal ion  
  * Common: 4 (tetrahedral or square planar) or 6 (octahedral)  
* Common ligands:

  * Monodentate: Form one coordinate bond (H₂O, NH₃, Cl⁻, OH⁻)  
  * Bidentate: Form two coordinate bonds (NH₂CH₂CH₂NH₂)  
  * Hexadentate: Form six coordinate bonds (EDTA⁴⁻)  
* Complex geometry:

  * Octahedral: 6-coordinate (e.g., \[Cu(H₂O)₆\]²⁺)  
  * Tetrahedral: 4-coordinate (e.g., \[CuCl₄\]²⁻)  
  * Square planar: 4-coordinate (e.g., cisplatin)

### 18.3 Color in Transition Metal Compounds

* Origin of color:

  * Splitting of d-orbitals by ligands  
  * Absorption of light causes d-d transitions  
  * Color observed is complementary to absorbed color  
* Factors affecting color:

  * Oxidation state: Different oxidation states have different colors  
  * Ligand: Different ligands cause different splitting  
  * Coordination number: Affects orbital splitting  
* Colorless compounds:

  * d⁰ configuration (e.g., Sc³⁺)  
  * d¹⁰ configuration (e.g., Zn²⁺)

### 18.4 Reactions of Transition Metal Ions

* With sodium hydroxide:

  * Form hydroxide precipitates  
  * Some dissolve in excess NaOH (amphoteric behavior)  
* With ammonia solution:

  * Form hydroxide precipitates  
  * Many dissolve in excess NH₃ forming complex ions  
    * E.g., \[Cu(H₂O)₆\]²⁺ → Cu(OH)₂ → \[Cu(NH₃)₄(H₂O)₂\]²⁺  
* Ligand exchange reactions:

  * H₂O replaced by other ligands  
  * E.g., \[Cu(H₂O)₆\]²⁺ \+ 4Cl⁻ → \[CuCl₄\]²⁻ \+ 6H₂O (color change blue to yellow)  
* Complex stability:

  * Multidentate ligands form more stable complexes than monodentate  
  * Due to entropy increase (chelate effect)

### 18.5 Catalysis

* Heterogeneous catalysis:

  * Catalyst in different phase from reactants  
  * Reactions occur on surface  
  * Steps: adsorption → bond weakening → reaction → desorption  
  * Examples:  
    * V₂O₅ in contact process  
    * Pt/Rh in catalytic converters  
* Homogeneous catalysis:

  * Catalyst in same phase as reactants  
  * Often involves redox cycling  
  * Examples:  
    * Fe²⁺ in I⁻ \+ S₂O₈²⁻ reaction  
    * Mn²⁺ in MnO₄⁻ \+ C₂O₄²⁻ reaction (autocatalysis)

  * Loss of H⁺ restores aromaticity  
* Phenol reactions:
