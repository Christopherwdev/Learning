## 12\. Kinetics

### 12.1 Rate Concepts and Measurement

* Key terms:

  * Rate of reaction: Change in concentration of reactant/product per unit time  
  * Rate equation: Rate \= k\[A\]^m\[B\]^n where k is the rate constant  
  * Order: Power to which concentration is raised in rate equation  
  * Overall order: Sum of individual orders (m \+ n)  
  * Half-life: Time for concentration to halve  
  * Rate-determining step: Slowest step in a multi-step reaction  
* Experimental techniques:

  * Titration: Samples removed and titrated at intervals  
  * Colorimetry: Measuring color change as reaction proceeds  
  * Mass change: For reactions producing/consuming gases  
  * Gas volume: Measuring volume of gas evolved  
* Determining order:

  * Initial-rate method: Using different starting concentrations  
  * Half-life method: Constant half-life indicates first order  
  * Graphical methods:  
    * Zero order: \[A\] vs time is straight line  
    * First order: ln\[A\] vs time is straight line  
    * Second order: 1/\[A\] vs time is straight line

### 12.2 Reaction Mechanisms

* Reaction mechanisms from rate equations:

  * Rate-determining step contains species that appear in rate equation  
  * If rate \= k\[A\]\[B\], both A and B are in the rate-determining step  
  * If rate \= k\[A\]², either A reacts with itself or 2A react in the rate-determining step  
* SN1 and SN2 mechanisms:

  * SN1 (unimolecular):  
    * Rate \= k\[RX\] (first order)  
    * Rate-determining step: Formation of carbocation  
    * Common for tertiary halogenoalkanes  
  * SN2 (bimolecular):  
    * Rate \= k\[RX\]\[Nu\] (second order)  
    * One-step mechanism with transition state  
    * Common for primary halogenoalkanes

### 12.3 Activation Energy

* Arrhenius equation:

  * k \= Ae^(-Ea/RT)  
  * Taking natural logarithms: ln k \= ln A \- Ea/RT  
  * Plot of ln k vs 1/T gives straight line with gradient \-Ea/R  
* Catalysts:

  * Heterogeneous: Catalyst in different phase from reactants  
    * Provides surface for adsorption  
    * Weakens bonds in adsorbed molecules  
  * Homogeneous: Catalyst in same phase as reactants  
    * Forms intermediate species

## 13\. Entropy and Energetics

### 13.1 Entropy

* Definition:

  * Measure of disorder/randomness in a system  
  * Symbol: S, units: J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹  
* Entropy trends:

  * Increases with temperature  
  * Increases in state changes: solid → liquid → gas  
  * Perfect crystals at 0 K have zero entropy  
* Entropy changes:

  * Phase changes: ΔS positive for melting/boiling  
  * Dissolving: Usually positive (more disorder)  
  * Reactions: Depends on change in number of gas molecules  
* Total entropy change:

  * ΔS\_total \= ΔS\_system \+ ΔS\_surroundings  
  * ΔS\_surroundings \= \-ΔH/T  
  * Reaction is feasible when ΔS\_total is positive  
* Temperature effect:

  * Higher temperatures favor endothermic reactions (ΔS\_surroundings becomes less negative)

* Born-Haber cycle:

  * Thermochemical cycle relating lattice energy to other energy terms  
  * Used to calculate lattice energy indirectly  
* Factors affecting lattice energy:

  * Ionic charge: Higher charge \= stronger attraction \= more negative lattice energy  
  * Ionic radius: Smaller radius \= stronger attraction \= more negative lattice energy  
* Covalent character:

  * Difference between experimental and theoretical lattice energy indicates covalent bonding  
  * Caused by polarization of anions by small, highly charged cations

### 13.3 Solution Energetics

* Key terms:

  * Enthalpy of solution: Energy change when one mole of solute dissolves  
  * Enthalpy of hydration: Energy released when one mole of gaseous ions are hydrated  
* Relation to lattice energy:

  * ΔH\_solution \= ΔH\_lattice \+ ΔH\_hydration  
  * Solubility depends on balance between these terms  
* Factors affecting solubility:

  * More negative hydration enthalpies favor solubility  
  * Less negative lattice energies favor solubility

  * K\_p: In terms of partial pressures (atm)  
    * K\_p \= (p\_C)^c(p\_D)^d / (p\_A)^a(p\_B)^b  
* Units:

  * Depend on overall change in number of moles  
  * If Δn \= 0, K\_c has no units  
  * If Δn ≠ 0, K\_c has units (mol dm⁻³)^Δn  
* Heterogeneous equilibria:

  * Pure solids and liquids omitted from equilibrium expressions

### 14.2 Equilibrium Position

* Effect of changes on equilibrium:

  * Concentration/pressure: Position changes to oppose change  
  * Temperature:  
    * Exothermic reaction: K decreases with temperature  
    * Endothermic reaction: K increases with temperature  
  * Catalyst: No effect on position, only on rate  
* Relation to entropy:

  * ΔS\_total \= R ln K  
  * Larger K means more positive ΔS\_total  
* Predicting extent of reaction:

  * Large K: Reaction goes almost to completion  
  * Small K: Reaction barely proceeds  
  * K ≈ 1: Significant amounts of all species present
