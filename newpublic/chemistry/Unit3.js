# Unit 3: Practical Skills in Chemistry I  

## 11\. Practical Skills Development

### 11.1 Key Practical Techniques

* Core techniques:  
  * Measuring mass and volume  
  * Preparing standard solutions  
  * Performing titrations  
  * Setting up reaction apparatus  
  * Purification methods (filtration, recrystallization, distillation)

### 11.2 Measurement and Observations

* Qualitative tests:  
  * Anions:  
    * CO₃²⁻: Add acid, produces CO₂ which turns limewater milky  
    * SO₄²⁻: Add acidified BaCl₂, produces white precipitate  
    * Halides (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻): Add AgNO₃ \+ HNO₃, gives characteristic precipitates  
  * Cations:  
    * NH₄⁺: Add NaOH \+ heat, produces ammonia (turns litmus blue)  
  * Gases:  
    * CO₂: Turns limewater milky  
    * O₂: Relights a glowing splint  
    * H₂: Burns with a 'pop' sound  
  * Organic functional groups:  
    * C=C: Decolorizes bromine water  
    * Aldehydes: Reduce Benedict's/Fehling's solution (blue to brick-red)  
    * \-OH: Reacts with PCl₅ producing steamy fumes of HCl

### 11.3 Data Analysis Skills

* Experimental validity:

  * Identifying variables to control  
  * Assessing measurement uncertainties  
  * Evaluating methods and suggesting improvements  
* Data processing:

  * Calculating concentrations, moles, and yields  
  * Using appropriate significant figures  
  * Applying mathematical skills to analyze results  
* Result evaluation:

  * Identifying errors and limitations  
  * Suggesting explanations for unexpected results  
  * Drawing valid conclusions from data
